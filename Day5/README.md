## View and mail images captured by Nasa's mars rovers

### Explore the Martian lands
Built on PyQt5, this Mars Rover Image Viewer and Mailer allows users to fetch and display the latest images captured by NASA's Mars rovers.
The app uses NASA's API to fetch the images and displays them in a user-friendly interface with options to filter images by date, rover and camera position.
